To help with your trip planning, you’ve embarked on a climate analysis of Honolulu, Hawaii. The following sections outline the steps to accomplish this task.

Part 1: Analyze and Explore the Climate Data

In this section, you’ll use Python and SQLAlchemy to perform a basic climate analysis and data exploration of your climate database. Specifically, you’ll utilize SQLAlchemy ORM queries, Pandas, and Matplotlib to analyze and visualize the data.

climate_starter.ipynb: This Jupyter notebook contains the initial climate analysis and exploration tasks. It demonstrates how to query the climate database, calculate summary statistics, and visualize the data.
app.py: This Flask application provides a web interface for your climate data analysis. It includes routes for retrieving precipitation data, listing stations, and querying temperature observations. Use this script to run a local server and interact with the climate data through API endpoints.
Part 2: Design Your Climate App

Now that you’ve completed your initial analysis, you’ll design a Flask API based on the queries that you just developed. This part involves creating routes in your Flask application to serve climate data in response to API requests.

Both files are saved in the surfs_up folder. Be sure to set up your Python environment and install the necessary packages before running the scripts.
